**Using Logistic Regression to Classify CVD Risk**

*Introduction:*
Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) kills more people than cancer globally. A dataset of real heart patients collected from a 15 year heart study cohort is made available for this assignment. The dataset has 16 patient features. Note that none of the features include any Blood Test information. 

In this project, we will build a Logistic Regression Model that predicts CVD Risk (Yes/No, or 1/0) based on patient information. This model is a binary classifier; the input of the model is the demographic data about the individual patient, and the output is the probability that the individual is at rist for CVD. If the probability is above 50%, the individual is classified as Yes, at risk.

*Process:*
The data is stored in a github raw link. Run the file and the outputs of the model will appear in the program.
